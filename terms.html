        <p style="font-size:14px;color:var(--text-soft);margin-bottom:24px;">
          Last updated: 2025
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:14px;color:var(--text-soft);max-width:720px;margin-bottom:24px;">
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) explain how you may use FlowSync System’s services
          and website. By using our website, booking a free setup, or becoming a client,
          you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          FlowSync System (“FlowSync”, “we”, “us”) provides automation and operations services
          for beauty &amp; aesthetics clinics, including message handling, booking support and
          related consulting.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Using our services</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to use our website and services only for lawful business purposes and in
          accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for ensuring any information you
          provide to us is accurate and kept up to date.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Accounts and access</h2>
        <p>
          If we create or are given access to any accounts on your behalf (for example
          Instagram, WhatsApp, booking tools or automation platforms), you remain responsible
          for those accounts. You must keep login details secure and let us know promptly if
          you suspect unauthorised access.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Fees, payments and trial</h2>
        <p>
          Where applicable, subscription fees are billed via our payment provider (such as
          Stripe) in line with the plan you select. Our 7-day trial is free unless otherwise
          stated; after that period, standard fees apply unless you cancel before the trial
          ends. Any specific commercial terms will be agreed with you separately.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          You may cancel your subscription in line with the cancellation process communicated
          to you (for example through your payment link or written agreement). We may suspend
          or terminate access to our services if you breach these Terms, fail to pay fees when
          due, or if we reasonably believe your use of the service creates risk to us or others.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data protection &amp; privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We handle personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including
          GDPR where relevant. Our
          <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains what data we collect, how we use
          it, and your rights. By using our services, you agree that we may process personal
          data as described there.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-party tools</h2>
        <p>
          FlowSync may connect to or use third-party tools and platforms (for example
          Instagram, WhatsApp, Calendly, Stripe or your booking software). Those services are
          provided under their own terms and privacy policies, which you are responsible for
          reviewing. We are not responsible for outages or changes to those third-party
          services.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          All content on our website, branding, copy and processes we develop are owned by
          FlowSync or licensed to us. You may not copy, reproduce or reuse our materials for
          other businesses without our written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          You must not use our services to send spam, misleading messages or content that is
          unlawful, discriminatory, threatening or otherwise inappropriate. We may suspend
          services if we reasonably believe your use breaches this requirement.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          We will not be liable for any loss of profits, revenue, business opportunities or
          indirect or consequential loss. To the extent permitted by law, our total liability
          for any claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or our services will
          be limited to the fees you paid to us in the 3 months before the claim arose.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect changes in our
          services or the law. When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated”
          date above and, where appropriate, let you know via email or our website.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Contact us</h2>
